# LSTM
### On LSTM architecture, I have tested the proposed function using the following datasets
#### 1. Sentiment Analysis using the imdb dataset containining 60,000 reviews
#### 2. Sequence to Sequence Translation using the English to French dataset saved under the filename fra.txt
#### 3. Text Generation using the nietzsche text, found in 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/text-datasets/nietzsche.txt'
# Autoencoders
#### Mnist Dataset using ELU vs SQLU
